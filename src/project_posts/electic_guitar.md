This is a project that I worked on before starting this blog. It actually was the project that made me wish I had documented more of the process. Unfortunately that also means that this page is criminally lacking in information, as I was not blogging as I went.

The start of the inspiration for this project was this Belgian dude posting videos of his guitar making, [Tchik guitars](https://www.youtube.com/@tchiksguitars).

I'm not sure why I decided to build a guitar. I can't even play guitar. But fuck was it fun to build and learn about. I think that, for me at least, building something is more about the build itself than the end result. It is about the journey, not the destination.

My boy tchiksguitars has a lovely 3 part tutorial for the beginner luthier.

Anyway, here is a bunch of pictures I had in my camera roll from this build, and my best memory of what the context of each one is.
