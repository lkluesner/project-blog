description: Rebuild of my old, orginial, Ender 3 3D printer. A complete structural overhaul from Cartesian to Core XY. Updated MCU software from stock to Klipper, an enclosure to print more tempermental filaments, and upgrades to the hotdend, extruder, and steppers.

An attempt to get my Ender 3 up to modern 3d printing standards, similar to Bambu labs.


## Flashing Klipper and Bit-Banging
One of the features that my Ender 3 was greatly lacking was an auto-bed leveling sensor, so one of the first things I wanted to do was add one. To do that, I neeeded to flash new software to the printer mainboard. 
My old Ender 3 has an old 8-bit Melzi MCU board, that was running some old version of Marlin. 
However, the 8-bit microcontroller in this board is still very outdated, so instead of flashing a new Marlin version that would run slowly on the 8-bits available, I decided to swap to Klipper.
Klipper lets you outsource the "thinking" part of your 3d printer to a Raspberry Pi. In my case, with a Pi 4, I now get a 64-bit quad core processor that can do much more than an 8-bit microcontroller.
